# CustomAndroidAnnotations
This project is intended to bring an approach to the **Custom Annotations** in Android. It will make use of the `RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME` as _retention policy_ and the following _element types_:

- `ElementType.CLASS`
- `ElementType.METHOD`
- `ElementType.PARAMETER`

It will show the use of this annotations throughout four examples:

- Class annotations.
- Method annotations.
- More on method annotations (this example will simulate the [Otto Event Bus] (https://github.com/square/otto) library).
- Method and Parameter annotations (this example will simulate the [Retrofit] (https://github.com/square/retrofit) library).
